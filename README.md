# R-Prices

This is a personal project aimed at learning to create a **Rust backend** using Actix, Juniper, Diesel, Reqwest, and Fantoccini, as well as developing a **frontend with Svelte**.

The backend includes a bot that periodically checks for price changes of various products. It achieves this by downloading an HTML website and locating the price tag, then comparing it with the price stored in the database.
